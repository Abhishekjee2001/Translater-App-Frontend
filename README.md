Translator Application 🌍

This is a simple language translator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The app allows users to translate text between different languages using an external translation API. 
This project helped me understand API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
